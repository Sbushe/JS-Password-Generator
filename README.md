# JS-Password-Generator

## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with turning a starter code of JavaScript into a working Password Generator. Specific criteria for the password include having a length of 8-128 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character types, for each prompt to be validated after selection, and for the generated password that matches the selected criteria to be displayed on the page. In the future, we may look into reworking the prompts into checkbox selections to improve user experience.
